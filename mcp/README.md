Adding Dynamic Capabilities to your (Semi)-Static LLM

LLMs and the transformer models are trained from large datasets
to capture things like correlations in the English language,
what makes a good bullet point, when is a good time to
end an answer on Reddit to a question on Reddit, etc.



However, they are not good at dynamic quantities like
who won a softball game last night, or the example we're
working on today, the weather.

The main reason is because this data is always changing, more
rapidly than AI companies can update the training of their LLM.

A reason related to the first, is that AI companies deliberately
do not train their LLMs on this data because there is so much of it
and it changes regularly. They have a certain electricity and time
budget when selecting which data to train, and they focus it on
data that has repeatable, predictive power (e.g. good children's birthday party ideas)
